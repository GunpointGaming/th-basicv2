# Atom syntax highlighting for Telehack BASIC

Colorful Telehack-style BASIC code for the Atom editor. Visit the homepage for the [language-thbasic package](https://atom.io/packages/language-thbasic) here, or download from directly within Atom.

Support for labels has been added, but the code needs to be run through the [BASIC Renumber](https://p85.github.io/renumber/renumber.html) program, either the Telehack, perl, or javascript version.

### Credits
Most of this code was taken from [language-cbmbasic package](https://atom.io/packages/language-cbmbasic), so credit where it's due, I didn't do most of it.
